        <h1>About me</h1>
<section>
My name is <b>Joshua Swift</b>.  
I am a long-time veteran of web development with over a decade of experience in the field.
<br/>
<br/>
My primary field of study is computer science with a web focus.  I usually stick to PHP but I am also familiar with a variety of languages and stacks including (but not limited to) Javascript, Python, C#, and Java.
<br/>
<br/>
I have enthusiastically authored and currently maintain over a dozen FOSS PHP packages which are available on github.
