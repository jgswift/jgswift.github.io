My name is <b>Joshua Swift</b>.  
I am a long-time veteran of web development with over a decade of experience in the field.

My primary field of study is PHP but I am also familiar with a variety of languages including Javascript, Python, C#, and Java.

I have enthusiastically authored and currently maintain over a dozen FOSS packages available on github.
